# Instructions

To generate NuMAD model file (*.nmd) from Excel spreadsheet:

(recommend to do this within the blade project folder where .nmd file typically resides)

-Enter information into NuMAD.xlsx (see instuctions included for information on spreadsheet contents)
-Execute xls2nmd.m from Matlab command line

Unfortunately, the process of converting the Excel worksheet to a clean and error-free NuMAD model can be wrought with errors if the NuMAD.xls information is not entered exactly as specified and in a manner that is consistent with NuMAD methodologies.  Please be aware of all details explained in the included instructions, "Xls2nmd Inputs.docx." (found in the Docs folder)
